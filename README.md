# Splunk Security Dashboards

Example security dashboard with event alerting work flows for Active Directory and Windows Events. This app is not a final solution to the entire security monitoring problem but outlines an approach to basic monitoring and alerting.

## Getting Started

### Index & Search Macro Configuration
 * Create an index for the security events generated by this app (e.g. securityevents)
* Create an index for the active directory summary info (e.g. activedirectory)
* Update the securityevents_index macro with your index name (Settings > Advanced Search > Search Macros)
* Update the activedirectory_index macro with your index name (Settings > Advanced Search > Search Macros)
* Update the windows_event_index macro with your Windows event log index (Settings > Advanced Search > Search Macros)
* Update the customer_name macro with your company name (Settings > Advanced Search > Search Macros)

### Setup Security Monitoring Use Cases
* Review the Default Security Use Cases and Disable/Enable Scheduled Searches As Required (Settings > Searches, Reports, and Alerts)
* Further information regarding Use Case concepts and details is located in [UseCases](UseCases.md)

### Setup Active Directory Monitoring
* In order to use the Active Directory summaries ensure the Add-on for ActiveDirectory is installed and configured (<a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1151/">https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1151/</a>)
* For each of the domains that should be monitored add an entry to the lookup table ldap_domains.csv. The domain and baseDN fields should match the name of the setting you configured in the Add-on for ActiveDirectory.
* Review the Default Active Directory Summary Searches and Disable/Enable Scheduled Searches As Required (Settings > Searches, Reports, and Alerts). Note: Active Directory searches all begin with "ActiveDirectory"
